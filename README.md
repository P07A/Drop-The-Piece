# Drop-The-Piece
A simple VR experience collecting raindrops with musical notes with a bucket and playing like an instrument

The game is built in Unity on Mac.

The colour of the bucket in the scene could be pink, which only happens in VR headsets such as Pico4. However, the game runs perfectly so please enjoy without concerning the colour of the bucket.

Due to its size, the apk file is uploaded only. Please email to

All you have to do to play the game is COLLECT THE RAINDROPS WITH THE BUCKET and PLAY MUSIC WITH THEM!
